## Hi, my name is Darko.

I am a software engineer from Skopje, Macedonia.

### Background

Previously, I was a graduate student in the [Department of Mathematics,
Statistics, and Computer Science](https://mscs.uic.edu/) at the
[University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu), where I got my PhD in
December 2019.

I am interested in all aspects of software engineering, but I am especially
passionate about applications driven by machine learning. You can read more
about my recent projects on my [portfolio page](/projects) or my
[Github profile](https://github.com/dtrifuno).

### Tools

I write backend code in **Python**, **TypeScript/JavaScript** and **Rust**, and
websites using **React**.

For machine learning and data science work, I mostly use **scikit-learn** and
**PyTorch**, but I am currently working on learning more about Bayesian methods
with **PyMC**.

### Opportunities

I am currently looking to transition to a full-time position. If you have a job
opening for which you think I might be a good match, please feel
free to [email me](mailto:dtrifuno@gmail.com).
